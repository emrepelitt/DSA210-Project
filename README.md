# DSA 210 Term Project: Car Price Prediction 

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the price of Mercedes and Honda vehicles based on various factors such as model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. By applying data science techniques, I will analyze how these attributes influence the value of cars.  

## 📊 Dataset  
1. **Mercedes Used Car Listing**: Contains data on used Mercedes cars, including price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size.

2. **Honda Cars Data**: Contains data on Honda vehicles such as model, condition, price, ratings, transmission, and more.

## 🔍 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
- The datasets are imported and cleaned to remove missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Features are analyzed for correlation with the target variable (price).
- Categorical variables are encoded appropriately for model training.
- Data from both datasets may be merged or analyzed separately depending on their structure and compatibility.
  
## 📈 Analysis Plan  
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Summary statistics and visualizations to explore relationships between variables.    
2. **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - Apply regression models to predict car prices.
3. **Model Interpretation**: Identifying key factors affecting car prices.  

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes  
- A predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on its attributes.  
- Insights into how different features (e.g., mileage, fuel type) impact car prices.  
- Potential recommendations for buyers and sellers in the used car market.
