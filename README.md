# DSA 210 Term Project: Car Price Prediction 

## Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the price of Mercedes and Honda vehicles based on various factors such as model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. By applying data science techniques, I will analyze how these attributes influence the value of cars.  

## **Motivation**
The used car market is a dynamic industry where prices fluctuate based on various factors such as brand, model, age, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and transmission type. However, accurately estimating the price of a used vehicle is not always straightforward.

This project aims to **predict the prices of used Mercedes and Honda cars** using machine learning models. Understanding the pricing patterns across different brands and models can help both buyers and sellers make more informed decisions.

Key motivations for this project include:
- **Market Analysis:** Identifying key factors influencing used car prices.
- **Prediction Model:** Developing a machine learning model to estimate car prices.
- **Comparative Study:** Analyzing and comparing the pricing dynamics of Mercedes and Honda vehicles.

## Dataset  
1. **Mercedes Used Car Listing**: Contains data on used Mercedes cars, including price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size.

2. **Honda Cars Data**: Contains data on Honda vehicles such as model, condition, price, ratings, transmission, and more.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing  
- The datasets are imported and cleaned to remove missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Features are analyzed for correlation with the target variable (price).
- Categorical variables are encoded appropriately for model training.
  
## Analysis Plan  
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Summary statistics and visualizations to explore relationships between variables.    
2. **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - Apply regression models to predict car prices.
3. **Model Interpretation**: Identifying key factors affecting car prices.  

## Expected Outcomes  
- A predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on its attributes.  
- Insights into how different features (e.g., mileage, fuel type) impact car prices.  
- Potential recommendations for buyers and sellers in the used car market.
