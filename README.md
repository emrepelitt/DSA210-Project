# DSA 210 Term Project: Car Price Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the prices of vehicles in the German automotive market based on various factors such as year, mileage, fuel type, horsepower, and transmission. By applying data science techniques, we will analyze how these attributes influence the market value of cars.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** [German Vehicle Price and Efficiency Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heidarmirhajisadati/german-vehicle-price-and-efficiency-dataset)  
- **Description:** This dataset contains 500 records of cars from popular German manufacturers. The dataset includes details such as:  
  - **Brand**: Car’s brand (Audi, BMW, Mercedes, etc.)  
  - **Model**: Specific model of the car  
  - **Year**: Manufacturing year (2005 - 2023)  
  - **Mileage**: Total kilometers traveled (5,000 - 300,000 km)  
  - **Fuel Type**: Petrol, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid  
  - **Fuel Consumption (L/100km)**: Average fuel consumption  
  - **Horsepower (HP)**: Engine power (70 - 500 HP)  
  - **Transmission**: Manual or Automatic  
  - **Price (€)**: Car price in euros (€5,000 - €100,000)  
  - **City**: Location in Germany  

## 🔍 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
- The dataset will be directly sourced from Kaggle.  
- Steps planned for data preprocessing:  
  1. Handle missing or inconsistent values.
  2. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.  
  3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations.  

## 📈 Analysis Plan  
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Summary statistics and visualizations to explore relationships between variables.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones for better model performance.  
3. **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - Apply regression models to predict car prices.
4. **Model Interpretation**: Identifying key factors affecting car prices.  

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes  
- A predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on its attributes.  
- Insights into how different features (e.g., mileage, fuel type) impact car prices.  
- Potential recommendations for buyers and sellers in the used car market.
