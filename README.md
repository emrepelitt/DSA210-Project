# DSA 210 Term Project: Car Price Prediction 

## Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the price of Mercedes and Honda vehicles based on various factors such as model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. By applying data science techniques, I will analyze how these attributes influence the value of cars.  

## **Motivation**
The used car market is a dynamic industry where prices fluctuate based on various factors such as brand, model, age, mileage, engine size, fuel type, and transmission type. However, accurately estimating the price of a vehicle is not always straightforward.

This project aims to **predict the prices of used Mercedes and Honda cars** using machine learning models. Understanding the pricing patterns across different brands and models can help both buyers and sellers make more informed decisions.

Key motivations for this project include:
- **Market Analysis:** Identifying key factors influencing used car prices.
- **Prediction Model:** Developing a machine learning model to estimate car prices.
- **Comparative Study:** Analyzing and comparing the pricing dynamics of Mercedes and Honda vehicles.

## Dataset  
The data that will be used in this project comes from publicly available datasets on Kaggle.
1. **Mercedes Used Car Listing**: Contains data on used Mercedes cars, including price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size.

2. **Honda Cars Data**: Contains data on Honda vehicles such as model, condition, price, ratings, transmission, and more.

## Data Analysis
The project follows a structured approach:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and removing irrelevant columns.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing relationships between variables to understand pricing trends.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing Machine Learning Models to predict car prices.

## Expected Findings
- Key factors affecting price might include mileage, fuel type, and engine size.
- Different brands may have different depreciation trends based on model popularity and market demand.

## Limitations and Future Work
- The datasets may not include all factors influencing car prices, such as accident history or region-specific demand.
- Future work could include integrating more brands and economic indicators, such as inflation and fuel price trends.
- The model could be further refined using deep learning techniques for better accuracy.
