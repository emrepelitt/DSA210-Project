# DSA 210 Term Project: Mercedes Used Car Price Prediction 

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the price of used Mercedes vehicles based on various factors such as model, registration year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, road tax, and transmission. By applying data science techniques, I will analyze how these attributes influence the market value of cars.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/mercedes-used-car-listing
- **Description:** This dataset provides information about Mercedes used car listings and includes key attributes such as:
  - **Model**: Specific model of the car  
  - **Year**: Registration year
  - **Price (€)**: Car price in euros
  - **Transmission**: Type of gearbox (Automatic, Manual, etc.) 
  - **Mileage**: Distance traveled by the car 
  - **Fuel Type**: Petrol, Diesel, etc.
  - **Road Tax**: Annual tax on the vehicle 
  - **MPG (Miles per Gallon)**: Fuel efficiency
  - **Engine Size**: Engine capacity in liters  

## 🔍 Data Collection and Preprocessing  
- The dataset will be directly sourced from Kaggle.  
- Steps planned for data preprocessing:  
  1. Handle missing or inconsistent values.
  2. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.  
  3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and correlations.  

## 📈 Analysis Plan  
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Summary statistics and visualizations to explore relationships between variables.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones for better model performance.  
3. **Machine Learning Models**:  
   - Apply regression models to predict car prices.
4. **Model Interpretation**: Identifying key factors affecting car prices.  

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes  
- A predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on its attributes.  
- Insights into how different features (e.g., mileage, fuel type) impact car prices.  
- Potential recommendations for buyers and sellers in the used car market.
